[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("LongDescription", @"Protect your equipment and imaging sessions with intelligent, real-time weather monitoring powered by AI vision models. AI Weather watches the sky so you don't have to.

🌩️ REAL-TIME WEATHER MONITORING:
• Automatic Sky Analysis: AI vision models analyze your all-sky camera images to determine cloud coverage, detect rain and fog
• Continuous Protection: Periodic image capture and analysis runs in the background during your entire imaging session
• Instant Alerts: Weather status updates in real-time with detailed condition reports and cloud coverage percentages
• Live Preview: See exactly what the AI sees with the built-in camera preview panel

📷 3 FLEXIBLE CAPTURE MODES:
• RTSP Stream: Live video from network IP cameras (Dahua, Hikvision, etc.) with real-time preview and snapshot extraction
• HTTP Image Download: Periodic image download from any URL — works with indi-allsky, AllSky, web cameras, and any HTTP-accessible image
• Folder Watch: Monitors a local directory for the latest image saved by any camera software — perfect for USB cameras or custom setups

🤖 5 AI PROVIDERS (Free to Advanced):
• Local (FREE, Offline): Built-in heuristic analysis using brightness, color distribution, and edge detection — no internet needed, no API costs
• GitHub Models (FREE): Access GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini vision models with just a GitHub token — no credit card required
• OpenAI: GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini for high-accuracy cloud and weather analysis
• Google Gemini: Gemini 1.5 Flash, 1.5 Pro, 2.0 Flash — fast and capable vision models
• Anthropic Claude: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, 3.5 Haiku, 3 Opus — excellent at detailed image understanding

🛡️ SAFETY FEATURES:
• Configurable Cloud Threshold: Set the cloud coverage percentage that triggers an Unsafe status (e.g., 50%, 70%, 90%)
• Rain Detection: Rain (including lens droplets) immediately triggers Unsafe — regardless of cloud threshold
• Fog Detection: Fog conditions immediately trigger Unsafe — protects optics and prevents wasted exposures
• Automatic Fallback: If the cloud AI provider fails, times out, or loses connectivity, the plugin falls back to local offline analysis
• 60-Second Timeout: All AI providers have a 60-second timeout to prevent indefinite hangs during analysis
• ASCOM SafetyMonitor Integration: Outputs a status file compatible with the ASCOM Generic File SafetyMonitor for third-party software integration

⚙️ EASY SETUP:
1. Configure your all-sky camera source (RTSP URL, HTTP URL, or watched folder path)
2. Choose an AI provider and enter your API key (or use Local for zero-config offline analysis)
3. Set your cloud coverage safety threshold
4. Connect the safety monitor under Equipment → Safety Monitor → All Sky Camera Safety Monitor
5. Start monitoring — the plugin automatically protects your sequences

💡 BEGINNER-FRIENDLY:
• Start with Local (offline) mode — no API keys needed, works out of the box
• Upgrade to GitHub Models for free AI-powered analysis with just a GitHub account
• Detailed activity log shows every analysis result for easy troubleshooting
• Works with any all-sky camera that provides RTSP, HTTP, or file-based output

⚡ PRO FEATURES:
• Custom Analysis Intervals: Configure how often the sky is analyzed (seconds between captures)
• Multiple Camera Support: Point to different camera sources as needed
• Robust Error Handling: Automatic recovery from network failures, API errors, and camera disconnects
• Detailed Logging: Every analysis result is logged with timestamp, provider, cloud percentage, and safety status
• Seamless NINA Integration: Works directly with NINA's safety monitor system to pause or abort sequences when conditions deteriorate

Transform your all-sky camera into an intelligent weather guardian. Focus on imaging while AI Weather keeps watch over your equipment and data.")]
